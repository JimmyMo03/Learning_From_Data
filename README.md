# Learning_From_Data

This GitHub repository contains two tasks that use machine learning concepts to identify patterns in data and cleanse it. 
The repository also includes a model that can accurately identify the type of banknote based on its features. 

These tasks and models have various applications in industries such as finance, retail, healthcare, and more.

The first task involves data cleansing, which is the process of detecting and correcting or removing corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset. 
The machine learning model used in this task can identify patterns in data and cleanse it by removing any outliers or errors. 
This is particularly useful in the finance industry, where data quality is critical for accurate financial forecasting and risk management.

The second task involves building a machine learning model that can accurately classify banknotes based on their features. 
The model is trained on a dataset that contains various attributes of banknotes such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis. 
Once trained, the model can accurately predict the type of banknote based on its features. 
This model can be useful in the banking and retail industries, where counterfeit detection is critical for preventing financial fraud.

The repository includes code for both tasks, along with sample datasets and documentation. 
The code is written in Python and uses popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. 

Overall, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in applying machine learning concepts to data cleansing and banknote classification.
